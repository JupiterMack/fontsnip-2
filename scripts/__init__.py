# scripts/__init__.py

"""
Initializes the 'scripts' directory as a Python package.

This package contains utility and helper scripts for the FontSnip application.
These scripts are typically run during development or setup, and are not part of
the main application's runtime logic.

For example, this is where the script to generate the pre-computed font
feature database resides.
