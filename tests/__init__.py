# tests/__init__.py

"""
Initializes the 'tests' directory as a Python package.

This package contains all automated tests for the FontSnip application.
The structure of this package should mirror the 'src' package to ensure
clear organization of tests.

Sub-packages may include:
- tests.processing: Tests for the image processing pipeline.
- tests.matching: Tests for the font feature extraction and matching logic.
- tests.ui: Tests for GUI components and user interactions (if applicable).
- tests.utils: Tests for miscellaneous utility functions.

This setup facilitates test discovery by frameworks like pytest.
